abstract = {The relative neighbourhood graph (RNG) of a set of n points on the plane is defined. The ability of the RNG to extract a perceptually meaningful structure from the set of points is briefly discussed and compared to that of two other graph structures: the minimal spanning tree (MST) and the Delaunay (Voronoi) triangulation (DT). It is shown that the RNG is a superset of the MST and a subset of the DT. Two algorithms for obtaining the RNG of n points on the plane are presented. One algorithm runs in 0(n2) time and the other runs in 0(n3) time but works also for the d-dimensional case. Finally, several open problems concerning the RNG in several areas such as geometric complexity, computational perception, and geometric probability, are outlined.}

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with the estimation of a local measure of intrinsic dimensionality (ID) recently proposed by Houle. The local model can be regarded as an extension of Karger and Ruhl's expansion dimension to a statistical setting in which the distribution of distances to a query point is modeled in terms of a continuous random variable. This form of intrinsic dimensionality can be particularly useful in search, classification, outlier detection, and other contexts in machine learning, databases, and data mining, as it has been shown to be equivalent to a measure of the discriminative power of similarity functions. Several estimators of local ID are proposed and analyzed based on extreme value theory, using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the method of moments (MoM), probability weighted moments (PWM), and regularly varying functions (RV). An experimental evaluation is also provided, using both real and artificial data.},
